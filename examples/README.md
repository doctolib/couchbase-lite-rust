# Running examples with Couchbase Sync Gateway & Server

Couchbase Lite is often used with replication to a central server, so it can be useful to test the full stack.
The examples in this directory aim at covering these use cases.

## Setup the Couchbase Sync Gateway & Server

This process is handled through docker images, with as an entry point the file `docker-conf/docker-compose.yml`.

The configuration files that might interest are:
- `docker-conf/couchbase-server-dev/configure-server.sh` -> sets up the cluster, bucket and SG user
- `docker-conf/db-config.json` -> contains the database configuration
- `docker-conf/sync-function.js` -> contains the sync function used by the Sync Gateway

To start both the Sync Gatewawy and Couchbase Server, move to `docker-conf` through a terminal and use:

```shell
$ docker-compose up
```
